## Definitions

*instruction selection* - In computer science, instruction selection is the stage of a compiler backend that transforms its middle-level intermediate representation (IR) into a low-level IR where each operation directly corresponds to an instruction available on the target machine.

*register allocation* - In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process of assigning a large number of target program variables onto a small number of CPU registers.

*instruction scheduling* - In computer science, instruction scheduling is a compiler optimization used to improve instruction-level parallelism, which improves performance on machines with instruction pipelines. Put more simply, without changing the meaning of the code, it tries to. Avoid pipeline stalls by rearranging the order of instructions.
